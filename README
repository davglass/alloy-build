Component Build for AlloyUI

Steps:

    Directories:
        /builder: git clone git://github.com/yui/builder.git
        /trunk: The trunk of your SVN source tree (can be a symlink)
        /alloy-build This repository
            /alloy-builder
                Contains the build scripts to build AlloyUI
                This folder needs to be symlinked to:
                    /builder/alloy
            /build
                This is where the build output goes
            /src
                This is where the raw source files go

    Files:
        setup.php
            This is a hacked PHP file to move the files from /trunk to
                /src, create the build.* files and create a directory structure
                **IT WILL REMOVE ALL THE FILES UNDER /src and /build SO BE CAREFUL**

        build.xml
            The template copied with the setup.php file
